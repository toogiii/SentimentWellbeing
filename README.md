# SentimentAndWellbeing
 
<h2>Introduction</h2>

This repository contains the replication code and data for Project 2 for ECON 1680. The code can be replicated by downloading all files, inserting them into a folder, and changing the path variable in the Jupyter notebook to wherever the directory containing the Code, Data, etc. folders is located on your host. The notebook is well annotated with comments explaining each step of the process, including data cleaning, sentiment measure generation, and regression analysis.
